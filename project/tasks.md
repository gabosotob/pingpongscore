# Introduction

This file is intended to be read by any person who wants to know how the development planning where thought and develop.

## Requirements, Tasks & Thoughts

On each requirement, a task would be assigned and all the thought process for choosing each solution is written inside along with the solution.

### 1. NodeJS for the backend

- [ ] Define system communication architecture

  Since it is a simple app for keeping score of ping-pong games, the scope of this project is simple:

  - We'll gonna go for a simple backend with full access for any user, so unauthenticated users can save and read app info
  - Deleting content is forbidden and makes sense for an app that doesn't perform authentications on its users.
  - The context of the app is an organization in which people play ping-pong, so a shared database will be useful for anyone playing to save the game score on a shared company database.

  We end up with:

  - A cloud-based database for shared data.
  - A local API for communicating with external DB.

- [ ] Setup Express.js app file structure

  Because makes more sense to work with the endpoints as actions for the entities of the app, the folder structure for the API will be their entities, so whatever case we are in with users, we will only touch the user's folder. Our folder structure for the source code looks like this:

  ðŸ“¦src
  â”£ ðŸ“‚api // Here it goes all related entities to interact with the app and database
  â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚games // Files related to the game's entities manipulation
  â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œgamesService.test.js // File for testing the game's service
  â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œmodel.js // The schema model that interacts with the database
  â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œrouter.js // All the routing-related with games
  â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œservice.js // The service controller for the router, that interacts with the model.
  â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚users
  â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œmodel.js
  â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œrouter.js
  â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œservice.js
  â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œusersService.test.js
  â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œindex.js // File containing all the routing for all entities of the API, all API routes go through here.
  â”£ ðŸ“‚configs // Contains all the configuration data files like environment variables
  â”— ðŸ“‚loaders // Files with the setup of dependencies of the app

### 2. Any database for storing data

- [ ] ## Define DB type based on size, type and queries to be made to the project app

  - Since it's a small app and will be a small development, we'll gonna use MongoDB for simple and easy configuration using Javascript.
  - We'll use Mongo Atlas for our cloud-based DB.

- [ ] Make ER Diagram

  The provided prototype only shows the use of the "Save Game" feature, but since 4 endpoints are needed for this project, **Games** and **Users** entities will be defined.

  - [ ] Define User model

    The model for the User is the name, the IDs of the winning games, and the IDs of the overall played games.

    ```javascript
    const UserSchema = {
      name: { type: String, required: true },
      wins: [{ type: Schema.Types.ObjectId }],
      games: [{ type: Schema.Types.ObjectId }],
    };
    ```

  - [ ] Define Game model

    The model for the Games is an array that represents the teams of the game, each team has a side of the table, the score and an array of player IDs. Then it's the status of the game, an object that contains the score difference between the teams

    ```javascript
    interface GameSchema {
      teams: [
        { side: string, score: number, players: number[] },
        { side: string, score: number, players: number[] }
      ];
      status: { scoreDiff: number, winner: string };
    }
    ```

### 3. At least 4 APIs (Up to you to decide; but adding some examples: Save users, get games, get users, get top performer from the last 5 games, save game)

- [ ] Define Storybook

  - A user enters the Ping Ping App, introduces players 1 and 2 names, then starts a new game
  - On the new game screen, A user adds wins to the corresponding player and sees the current score of each player with the resulting score difference between players, and the current winner of the playing game
  - Once the game has been seized, a user saves the game score into the app's game records

- [ ] Design API endpoints

  Required for Prototype:

  - [ ] Save game: POST request with JSON body of the game info
    ```json
    {}
    ```

  Extra

  - [ ] Get games
  - [ ] Save users: POST request with a JSON body of the name of the user
  - [ ] Get users: GET request gets all users of DB unless a query with the specific id of the user is provided

- [ ] Get the game with the worst score of all time

### 4. You must use some linter for theÂ code

- Define linter, standard and guide rules
- Define formatter

### 5. You must use git for version control (at least 2 commits)

### 6. You must have at least oneÂ test

### 7. You must include a README with instructions on how to run the application

### 8. Not required to create a front-end. However, if you manage to build a small UI that would be great.
